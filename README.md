### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. A lesson that we covered in this lesson would be the use of HTML and DOM Nodes. JavaScript treats web page content as a set of related components (objects) and every element on a web page is an object and a user can create objects such as functions.
2. A concept that we covered in this lesson would be what a HTML Dcomuent Object Model is, which is when a web page is loaded, the browser creates a DOM of the page and shows the heirarchy of the objects in a tree model.
3. A concept that we covered in this lesson would be what a Browser Object Model is. A BOM or client-side object model. It alse uses a heirarchy of objects and a window object represents a web browser window and is also called the global object.
